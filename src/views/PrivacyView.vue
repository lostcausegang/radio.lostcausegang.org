        <h2>Radio Frontend</h2>
        <p>Radio Lost Cause web app is where you are right now. We don't collect visitor/listener information for any
            purpose
            whatsoever. We don't use cookies. We don't send or receive data from third parties, such as CDNs, web font
            libraries, analytics, ad-tech, etc. We don't use Cloudflare or similar services.</p>
        <h2>Radio Backend</h2>
        <p>This is what powers the audio stream you listen to. We use <a href="https://www.azuracast.com/"
                target="_blank">AzuraCast</a> which is
            an open-source self-hosted solution for web radio stations. Our instance of AzuraCast is configured to collect
            only aggregate statistics. Aggregate listener statistics are used to show station reports across the system. We
            don't share these with anyone and only staff with admin access to AzuraCast dashboard can see the data. Having
            aggregate statistics means we can know what songs perform better and fine-tune our choice of music to listeners'
            preferences.</p>
        <h2>Then how do you make money? Where's the catch?</h2>
        <p>We don't. And there's no catch. Radio Lost Cause is a free public service and is financed by Lost Cause Gang
            directly. Its purpose is to share music from independent artists, not to make money.</p>
