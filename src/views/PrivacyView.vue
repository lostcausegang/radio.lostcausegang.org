        <h2>Radio Frontend</h2>
        <p>Radio Lost Cause web app is where you are right now. We don't collect visitor/listener information for any
            purpose
            whatsoever. We don't use cookies. We don't send or receive data from third parties, such as CDNs, web font
            libraries, analytics, ad-tech, etc. We don't use Cloudflare or similar services.</p>
        <h2>Radio Backend</h2>
        <p>This is what powers the audio stream you listen to. We use <a href="https://www.azuracast.com/"
                target="_blank">AzuraCast</a> which is
            an open-source self-hosted solution for web radio stations. Our instance of AzuraCast is configured to not
            collect any listener analytics. Yes, we don't even know how many listeners we have, not to say about
            location or listening time.</p>
        <h2>Then how do you make money? Where's the catch?</h2>
        <p>We don't. And there's no catch. Radio Lost Cause acts as a public service and is financed by Lost Cause Gang
            directly. Its purpose is to share music from independent artists, not to make money. Donations are
            definitely welcome since they allow us to grow and cover infrastructure costs but in on way they are
            required.</p>
